import demo1    

print("It's time to calculate")

# now if i run by importing this demo1 module and now before name variable 
# this will do the whole functionality of demo1 first then calc1 functionality are there

# and if i want this like if execution starts from the demo1 then only print that functionality otherwise not
# so for this we use __name__ variable as if __name__ variable is only equals to __main__ then only do these functionality of demo1
